This forms part of my master thesis for the Text Mining Linguistics Master at the VU. 

Here, a CNN-BiLSTM and a simple SVM is used to classify Dutch tweets written by members of the Dutch parliament into emotion categories (6 labels), binary purpose categories (2 labels) and basic polarity categories (3 labels). 

The baseline SVM resulted in a highest f1-score of 0.59 with polarity labels (positive, negative, neutral). The CNN-BiLSTM performed very low in all other categories as it needs more training data.
